Building on SBSTâ€™s first year of results, on September 15th, 2015, President Obama issued an executive order directing Federal Government agencies to apply behavioral science insights to their programs to better serve the American people. The members of SBST, a subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council, represent more than 25 organizations across government including the Departments of Defense, Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, and Education, and have worked to complete more than 30 pilots with rigorous evaluations.

  The 2016 Annual Report presents the results of completed projects and describes ongoing efforts in eight key policy areas: promoting retirement security, advancing economic opportunity, improving college access and affordability, responding to climate change, supporting criminal justice reform, assisting job seekers, helping families get health coverage and stay healthy, and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of Government operations.

  As a result of SBST projects in 2015, more Servicemembers are saving for retirement, more students are going to college and better managing their student loans, more Veterans are taking advantage of education and career counseling benefits, more small farms are gaining access to credit, and more families are securing health insurance coverage. And improvements in government program integrity and efficiency are saving taxpayer dollars.
