Building on SBST’s first year of results, on September 15th, 2015, President Obama issued an executive order directing Federal Government agencies to apply behavioral science insights to their programs to better serve the American people. Results from 2016 initiatives, highlighted in SBST’s second annual report, showcase the impact of this approach. The members of SBST, a subcommitte of the National Science and Technology Council, represent more than 25 organizations across government including the Departments of Defense, Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, and Education, and have worked to complete more than 30 pilots with rigorous evaluations.
